# Security Architecture

## Authentication & Authorization

### Authentication Layer
- OAuth 2.0 with OpenID Connect implementation
- JWT tokens with short expiry times (15 minutes)
- Refresh token rotation for extended sessions
- Multi-factor authentication for admin operations

### Authorization Model
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for admin functions
- Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) for customer operations
- Centralized policy service using OPA (Open Policy Agent)

## Data Security

### Encryption Strategy
- TLS 1.3 for all client-server communication
- Data-at-rest encryption for all PII and payment information
- Field-level encryption for sensitive data fields
- Key rotation policy and management

### PCI DSS Compliance
- Tokenization of payment information
- Segregated payment processing network
- Limited data retention policies

## API Security

### Request Validation
- Schema validation at API gateway
- Input sanitization for all user-provided data
- Parameter validation rules enforced at entry points

### Attack Prevention
- Web Application Firewall (WAF) integration
- OWASP Top 10 mitigation strategies
- Bot detection and challenge mechanisms

## Monitoring & Incident Response

### Security Monitoring
- Anomaly detection for unusual access patterns
- Failed authentication attempt monitoring
- Real-time security event correlation

### Incident Response
- Automated threat containment procedures
- Defined escalation paths
- Regular security drills and table-top exercises
