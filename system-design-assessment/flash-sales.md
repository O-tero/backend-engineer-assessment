# Flash Sales Architecture

## Challenges
- High concurrency (thousands of requests per second)
- Inventory accuracy
- System stability under load
- Fair user experience

## Solution Architecture

### Inventory Reservation System
- Pre-allocated inventory quotas
- Two-phase commit pattern for inventory deduction
- Optimistic locking in database operations

### Queue Management
- Virtual waiting room implementation
- Redis-based distributed queue with position tracking
- Timestamped entry tokens to prevent queue jumping

### Caching Strategy
- Read-through cache for product details
- Write-behind cache for order processing
- Separate Redis instance dedicated to flash sales

### Traffic Management
- Progressive rollout of flash sale visibility
- Geographically distributed CDN edge caching
- Dynamic scaling of processing capacity

### Monitoring & Control
- Real-time dashboard for sales progress
- Circuit breakers configured with lower thresholds
- Automated scaling policies based on queue length

### Database Considerations
- Separate database instance for flash sale inventory
- In-memory counters with periodic persistence
- Denormalized data structures for read performance
