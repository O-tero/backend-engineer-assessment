# API Rate Limiting Implementation

## Design Overview

The rate limiting system implements a multi-faceted approach to protect backend services from overload while ensuring fair resource allocation.

## Key Components

### Token Bucket Algorithm
- **Implementation**: Redis-backed distributed counter
- **Configuration**: 
  - Default: 100 requests per minute per user
  - Premium users: 300 requests per minute
  - Anonymous: 30 requests per minute
  - Flash sale endpoints: Dynamic scaling based on capacity

### Limit Types
- **User-based limits**: Tied to authentication tokens
- **IP-based limits**: For unauthenticated requests (prevents scraping)
- **Service-based limits**: Prevents cascading failures between services
- **Endpoint limits**: Higher limits for read operations, stricter for writes

### Burst Handling
- **Short bursts**: Allow temporary exceeding of limits with decay
- **Queuing mechanism**: For critical operations during peak times

### Technical Implementation
- Redis for distributed counting with TTL-based expiry
- Header-based feedback: X-RateLimit-Remaining, X-RateLimit-Reset
- Graceful degradation: Return cached content when appropriate

### Response Strategy
- HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) with Retry-After header
- Circuit breaking for internal service communication
- Priority queueing for premium users during flash sales
